# 🌾 AgroChain
### A Transparent and Direct Marketplace for Farmers

AgroChain is a decentralized agricultural marketplace designed to eliminate intermediaries and create a fair, transparent, and secure trading ecosystem for farmers and buyers. By leveraging **Blockchain**, **Smart Contracts**, **IoT**, and **AI-driven analytics**, AgroChain ensures fair pricing, secure payments, real-time traceability, and predictive market insights.

## 🚜 Problem Statement
Traditional agricultural supply chains suffer from:
- Exploitation by middlemen
- Lack of price transparency
- Delayed or failed payments
- No traceability of produce quality
- Limited market access for small farmers

AgroChain addresses these challenges through a technology-driven, community-focused solution.
