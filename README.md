# 🌾 AgroChain
### A Transparent and Direct Marketplace for Farmers

AgroChain is a blockchain-based agricultural marketplace that connects farmers directly with buyers, ensuring transparent pricing, secure smart contract payments, and real-time produce traceability using IoT. It also leverages AI-driven price forecasting and market insights to empower farmers and build trust across the agricultural supply chain.

---

## 🚜 Problem Statement
Traditional agricultural supply chains suffer from exploitation by intermediaries, lack of price transparency, delayed payments, and no reliable traceability of produce quality. AgroChain addresses these challenges using modern decentralized technologies.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable direct farmer-to-buyer transactions
- Automate secure payments using blockchain smart contracts
- Provide AI-based price prediction and anomaly detection
- Ensure real-time crop tracking using IoT
- Support digital inclusion via SMS and village ambassadors

---

## 🧩 System Architecture
AgroChain uses a multi-layer architecture consisting of:
- User Layer (Farmers, Buyers, Admins)
- Application Layer (Smart Contracts, Escrow, Dashboards)
- Blockchain Layer (Hyperledger Fabric)
- IoT & AI Analytics Layer
